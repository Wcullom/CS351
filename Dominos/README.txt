Wesley Cullom
CS351 Dominos Project


Unfortunately my dominos project did not get completed.
So far I have everything that would take care of the game logic itself, but I was unable to 
make it all onto the GUI. My program does compile and gives you the basic board layout. 

I have a version of the game that test my methods all in the command terminal in my git hub.
Got a little behind on the incremental development. I’m really hoping to turn it around on the boggle project.

The JAR file included does execute and run. I tried rebuilding the jar file several times with the correct name 
and it still keeps coming up as the original project name of “DominoCheap”. IntellJ shows the file for the .jar 
should be “WesleyCullomDomino.jar” but keeps building as this. 

I have included a very basic design diagram in my zipped folder.
